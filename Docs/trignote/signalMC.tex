\section{Signal Acceptance}
\label{sec:signalMC}

Here we look at signal acceptance for 5e32 (and later) triggers.

\subsection{GGMSB global acceptance}

SUSY GMSB MC with a coarse grid in $m_{squark}$ = (600,800,1000,1500) GeV, $m_{gluino}$ = (700,900,1200,1600) GeV,
and $m_{wino}$ = (100,300,500) GeV.  The SLHA (ref) SUSY spectra files were generated with SUSPect (ref).
About 2500 events were generated at each grid point and run through the full detector simulation ("fullsim") 
using CMSSW\_3\_11\_1.  For this first study no photon enriching filtering was applied.

Figure \ref{fig:genphotons} shows what percentage of each of these 
generated bins included a generated "prompt" photon from the decay of a $\chi_0$.  One sees fluctuation
between the bins in $m_{squark}$ and $m_{gluino}$ due to statistics in the samples, and a general
trend towards a decreasing percentage of the sample containing prompt photons as the Wino mass increases.
With a Wino mass of 100 GeV the majority of the events include a photon resulting from $\chi_0$ decay.
